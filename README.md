# Sales-Analysis-and-forecasting

This project presents an intermediate-level analysis of retail sales data using Python. It includes data exploration, time series forecasting using the SARIMA model, and regression analysis to uncover patterns and trends in historical retail performance.

Project Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends and seasonality

Clean and preprocess the dataset for modeling

Build a SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) model for time series forecasting

Apply linear regression to examine relationships between features and sales

Visualize data insights and model outputs
